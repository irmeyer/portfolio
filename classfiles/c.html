            <h3>Payroll Calculator Program (C Language) - C291 Assignment </h3>
            <p>This project is a payroll calculation program developed in C for Indiana University's C291 Systems
                Programming course. The program allows a payroll clerk to input monthly payroll data for different types
                of
                workers, including
                Administrators, Staff, Hourly, Adjunct Faculty, Regular Faculty, and Teaching Assistants. It calculates
                and
                reports the average monthly salary and pay for each category while handling specific constraints such as
                overtime limits and pay codes using a switch statement.</p>

            <p> Key Features: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>User input for payroll data with structured prompts</li>
                <li>Salary and pay calculations based on predefined formulas</li>
                <li>Error handling for invalid payroll codes (extra credit) </li>
                <li>Structured output displaying payroll summaries</li>
                <li>Restrictions on loop nesting and required use of switch statements</li>
                <li>Well-documented code with pseudocode and comments for readability</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Payroll Earnings Statement Program (C Language) - C291 Assignment</h3>
            <p>This project is a C-based payroll reporting program for the Bloomington Skating Company, designed as
                part of Indiana
                University's C291 Systems Programming course. The program calculates monthly payroll earnings,
                including sales
                commissions, bonuses, tax withholdings, and Social Security contributions for employees based on
                company profit and
                individual tenure.</p>

            <p>Key Features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>User input for sales and tenure data for up to 5 employees</li>
                <li>Calculation of commissions, bonuses, federal/state tax withholdings, and Social Security</li>
                <li>Structured output displaying payroll details, including net pay and net company profit</li>
                <li>Implementation of key operations using functions and arrays for modular design</li>
                <li>Detailed comments, function prototypes, and meaningful variable names.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Programming Constraints:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sales and tenure data stored in arrays
                <li>Defined functions for key calculations (e.g., commission, bonus, taxes, net pay)
                <li>Pseudocode documentation and structured comments for readability
                <li>No use of "magic numbers" (hardcoded values)
            </ul>
            <p>Extra Credit Opportunity:</p>
            <p>An additional 5 points can be earned by implementing a generic withholding function that is used
                across
                all tax calculations.</p>

            <h3>Buffer Indexing Program (C Language) - C291 Assignment</h3>
            <p>This project is a C-based text processing program for analyzing and indexing unique words in a given
                input.
                The program reads up to 2048 characters from stdin, stores them in a buffer, identifies unique words,
                and generates a
                report summarizing their occurrences, positions, and lengths.</p>

            <p>Key Features:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reads up to 2048 bytes from stdin or until EOF</li>
                <li>Identifies unique words and indexes their positions, lengths, and counts</li>
                <li>Outputs a structured report listing each word's position, length, and frequency</li>
                <li>Ensures that only the function loading the buffer modifies it; all others access it as read-only
                </li>
                <li>Implements a modular driver architecture with separate functions for buffer handling, indexing, and
                    reporting</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Programming Constraints:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No global variables; all variables must be locally scoped</li>
                <li>Uses a multi-dimensional array to store word indices, lengths, and counts
                    main() serves as a driver function that calls separate functions for processing</li>
                <li>Meaningful variable names and structured comments for readability</li>
                <li>No use of "magic numbers" (hardcoded values)</li>
            </ul>
